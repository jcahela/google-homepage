# google-homepage
mini Google project for The Odin Project

For this project, I need to recreate the vanilla Google homepage to the best of my ability.

I will need to demonstrate the following skills:

- linking images using <a href></a>
- positioning elements around the home page
- creating an HTML file with a header, body, and footer
- Using CSS to style and size the elements to match the Google homepage
- Use Developer Tools to tweak the web page from the browser

Good luck and take your time!

7/26: Completed the project.

I learned about:

- Turning elements into block style using display: block
- Centering block elements using margin: 0 auto;
- Using relative positioning to move a block element up or down based on its normal position within the flow of the webpage
- Using dev tools to find the color and background color of the buttons/footer
- Spacing out items within divs, spacing out divs within sections such as Nav and Footer
- Adding padding to containers to give space for the items within their containers
- Using CSS that targets IDs to override a class-specific styling
	Ex. Each element within a div has a right-margin of 10px whereas the last item has no right-margin
